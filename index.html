              <p class="card-text">Limasawa Island, Southern Leyte – everyone (well not all, but at least this one’s in Philippine history) probably knows about this as the spot where the first Christian mass in the country was held. Yes, it’s historic but it doesn’t have that popularity as the Sinulog celebration in Cebu. You know what? I love it that way. Though I’m into tourism and I’m helping travelers on how to explore such place, I think maintaining that low key and laid back vibe of the island is crucial. I think the island of Limasawa won’t be able to contain a huge crowd every March to celebrate the first mass of the country. Anyway, this blog isn’t about the historical value of Limasawa Island but on its tourist spots.</p>

It was built to avoid the perennial landslide dangers in the area during heavy rains. It keeps the Mahaplag-Sogod section of the Maharlika Highway open and safe by creating the viaduct to bypass the original route that was carved on the side of the mountain.</p>

People say that it is Leyte’s version of Boracay because of its white sand, crystal blue waters and panoramic landscape. Tangkaan Beach is one of the white sand beaches in Southern Leyte. It is also famous for its beautiful and exciting rock formations. Tangkaan Beach is not just a place of relaxation and enjoyment. It is also a place of history. The name Tangkaan is from the word “tangka” which means to attempt because in the past the Moro raiders attempted many times to invade Padre Burgos but because of the strong wind and big waves, they weren’t able to land their boats.</p>

              <p class="card-text">
                The Cathedral of Nuestra Señora De Asunsion, otherwise known as Maasin Cathedral, was built in the 17th-century, making it the oldest as well as the biggest church in the city. Various religious orders have served in the church, including the Jesuits, the Augustinians, and the Franciscans. The church was destroyed thrice in its history. The present church was completed in 1968, the same year that it was declared the seat of the Diocese of Maasin. As such, don’t be surprised to find a more modern interior in the cathedral, versus its antique façade. However, some of the statues of saints still harken back to the Spanish era. Note that the church is only open if there is mass. However, there is mass every day at 11 am, so visitors who want to visit can schedule their trip to arrive at or near that time. As a side note, history buffs may also want to explore St. Joseph College, right beside Maasin Cathedral, which was constructed in 1928. The city itself has several colonial-era houses dotting the streets.

Several of them have very outstanding features like the Tabunan Cave which was featured in the 2007 PNOC Calendar. The turnoff to these spectacular caves is 10km west of Burgos in Molopolo, a barangay of Macrohon. From here a partially paved road leads 7km to Cambaro, where you can secure guides and flashlights at the barangay hall. For two consecutive weeks, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) regional and provincial offices took the lead in gathering various sectors to draft plans designed to manage two caves in the province. The management function focuses on sustainability, to see to it that the caves remain protected and preserved, ensure visitors’ safety, even as uses for tourism purposes and other development projects are considered.</p>

The best thing about this place is the chance of having the entire beautiful marine sanctuary all by yourself (or with your group) for a day! They can only entertain one group of visitors per day since they only have one cottage, which is specially located at the center of the marine sanctuary. Amazing! They also offer exciting activities such as paddle boarding, snorkeling and many more (soon) for an affordable price.</p>
